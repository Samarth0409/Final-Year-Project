Software Defect Prediction
In software engineering, predicting software bugs is a critical attempt that seeks to find potentially problematic modules early in the software development life cycle. In terms of foreseeing errors in 
software, machine learning algorithms have produced positive findings. An abstract of a study investigating the effectiveness of various machine learning methods for software defect prediction is 
presented in this paper. The performance of various algorithms, including as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks, is trained on and assessed using a number 
of publicly accessible datasets.

The findings shows that machine learning algorithms are highly successful in predicting software bugs, and that ensemble techniques like random forests may enhance performance. Insights from the study can 
be used by software practitioners and engineers to select the best machine learning algorithms for software defect prediction, which can save development costs and raise software quality.
In order to solve the problems of traditional SVM classifier for software defect prediction, this paper proposes a novel dynamic SVM method based on improved cost-sensitive SVM (CSSVM) which is 
optimized by the Genetic Algorithm (GA).
